								<h3>This Page...</h3>
								<p>Is under construction.<p>
								<!--  <p>Is an application I developed of my own volition out of a desire to simplify and semi-automate a repetitive task. The task involved taking data from a website, used for digital class registration, and converting it into a sign in sheet for said class. </p>

								<p>The process was being done manually and near daily by myself or coworkers for the computer classes hosted by the Digital Services Department of the Gail Borden Library. To accomplish this involved a number of steps mostly involving formatting the Excel file into a checklist style format to verify student info and record attendance.  </p>

								<h4>...Had Challenges...</h4>
								<p>In starting this project the original idea had been to create an Excel Macro using VBA. Being an area of development with which I was unacquainted I started by doing some research. Through this and several attempts to implement some of the specific features of the app it was made clear that due to the technical limitations this was not the direction in which to proceed. From there the decision was made to use C# instead. </p>

								<p>In designing this application I attempted to hardcode as few things as possible. However there were some things that I believed had no way of implementing them without hardcoding. After close to a year of use the library changed the company that provided the class registration website. In doing this the data from the website changed slightly and this application could no longer read the data correctly. This caused a realization that by creating a settings menu for the application I could remove the need to hardcode those things and make the application more flexible and hopefully remove the need for a reprogramming when small changes occured. </p>

								<p>In the process of redesigning I decided that I needed to change the name of the application the name I had originally given it had been intended as only a temporary one till a better one could be found. This had unintentionally not happened. Along with changing the name I decided to challenge myself and develop both a better GUI and my own logo. Stepping out of my more limited artistic boundaries. This process I found some what more challenging than programming and relied on the suggestions and guidance from my artistic acquaintances. </p>

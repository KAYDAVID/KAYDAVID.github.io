								<h3>This Project...</h3>
								<p>I set a challenge for myself in designing this project to complete an entire game in 24 hrs. Making everything from scratch.<p>
								<p>I had previous experience making games but had a tendency to shoot for a goal too high, and because of ability, time, or technological constraints and even just motivation, fail to complete the project.</p>
								<p>Having heard from various creators that setting some strict limits for your project at the beginning and sticking to them can have a great effect on completing a project I decided to create a game with two strict limits. Time and Resources.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Unique Challenges...</h4>
								<p>Limiting my time was very effective in helping me keep on track and completing steps towards the finish line. It helped me get rid of unnecessary time sinks such as wasting time struggling to implement something that may be cool but not critical to the goal. Or constantly trying to add new features and ideas jumping from idea to idea without fully completing anything. Taking on this extreme deadline has helped me in my work on other projects to remember to keep my focus and set myself small goals and deadlines.</p>

								<p>Setting the challenge of creating all the resources from scratch helped push me out of my comfort zone in this project and work on things that were not in my area of expertise. Such as music and sound effects, as well as art and UI design.</p>

								<p>The UI design I found to be the easiest to understand but tricky to implement correctly however the art was harder than I had anticipated as my first attempts did not look quite right. The music and sound effects were the most time consuming as I tried to get the feeling I was working to evoke with the game. That Old School Arcade style.</p>
